I am a *0th-year* Computer Science PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin and a member of the [UTOPIA Research Group](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) where I work with my adviser [Prof. Işıl Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/)  on research problems related to programming languages (PL).

My current research interests lie within the intersection of Formal methods, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence, and I am particularly interested in teaching computers how to reason about programs using a "mathematical intuition". My long-term research goal is to explore ways to integrate machine learning techniques into PL techniques so that we can develop more scalable approaches for automated program analysis and synthesis.

Before I joined UTOPIA, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China.


Why Study Programs?
===================
Our civilization runs on software. Nearly every aspects of our modern life depends on the effectiveness and correctness of programs. Yet as we all know, developing software is an error-prone process and usually requires significant manual effort.

On the other hand, studying programs also helps us understanding mathematics. In essense, the specification of a program is just a mathematical proposition, and to develop a program that meets this specification is just to search for a proof that proves this proposition. This direct relationship between programs and mathematical proofs is called [Curry-Howard Isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry–Howard_correspondence). Hence, an effective program synthesizer can be used to solve any mathematical problems. And I find this extremly exciting because this allows us to build a universal mathematical intelligence and can have a profound influence on other sicentific discipline.
