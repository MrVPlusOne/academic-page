I am a *0th-year* Computer Science PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin and a member of the [UTOPIA Research Group](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu) where I work with my adviser [Prof. Işıl Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/)  on research problems related to programming languages (PL).

My current research interests lie within the intersection of Formal methods, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence, and I am particularly interested in teaching computers how to reason about programs using a "mathematical intuition". My long-term research goal is to explore ways to integrate machine learning techniques into PL techniques so that we can develop more scalable approaches for automated program analysis and synthesis.

Before I joined UTOPIA, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China.
